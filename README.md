# Website development project focused on UX/UI design principles

A completed project from the course COMPSCI345 at the University of Auckland

The requirements were to develop a website remodelling off another, using a designated thematic colour.
The focus of the project were on UX/UI design principles and functionality was not a high consideration.

A report document details the design choices made and the functional/visual aspects of the developed website.
